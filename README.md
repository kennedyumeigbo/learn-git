This is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code, or a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## Explain difference between git and GitHub:
GitHub is based upon Git. In other words, Git is independent of GitHub, but Git Hub cannot function without Git.
GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features; while, Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
