## Explain version control:
This is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code, or a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## Explain difference between git and GitHub:
GitHub is based upon Git. In other words, Git is independent of GitHub, but Git Hub cannot function without Git.
GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features; while, Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

## List 3 other GitHub alternatives:
GitLab, Bitbucket, and Gitea.

## Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull:
Git fetch and pull is that git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. The git pull command does both. In simple terms, git pull does a git fetch first, and then a git merge.
